# Weather-Dashboard-Project

## Description

This is my repository for the UC Berkeley eDX Bootcamp's challenge for Week 6: Server Side APIs. I completed this challenge to demonstrate how to connect to and retrieve data from external APIs in a program utilizing JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

This repository contains the code for a one-page weather dashboard. When the user enters the name of a city into the search input, the site connects with the openweathermap.org's API to retrieve and display the city's current weather forecast on a location card. It also retrieves and display the five day forecast via separate five day forecast cards.

If a new city is searched in the input, the data in both the location and five day forecast cards are updated.

All weather data is added to the local storage.

A card is also generated with the user's search history. A new card created each time a new city is searched for.
